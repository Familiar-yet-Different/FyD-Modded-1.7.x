If you have textures you made and would like them in the pack please create a pull request or post them on the Forum.
Feel free to submit textures for any version of the pack.
Textures for version 1.6.x or 1.7.x are preferred.

Please keep files no bigger than 16p.
*Unless there is a good reason for it*

Please use the template files for base colors and shading.
*The template files also have the commonly used items already created so you only need to copy them out*

Please keep colors consistent.
*I take into account what an item/block is made of along with that the original texture was when making a texture*

All dusts, ingots, blocks, and ores of the same kind from different mods should be the same texture.
*There may be exceptions to this*

If you need to make a new material color add it to the template and label it in the text file.
