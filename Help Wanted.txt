If you have textures you made and would like them in the pack please create a pull request or post them on the Forum.
Feel free to submit textures for any version of the pack. (1.2.X, 1.4.X, 1.5.X, 1.6.X)

Please keep files no bigger than 16p.(unless your doing sheet textures for old versions)

Please use the template files for base colors and shading.
(the template files also have the commonly used items already created so you only need to copy them out)

Please keep colors consistent.
(I take into account what an item/block is made of along with that the original texture was when making a texture)

If you need to make a new material color add it to the template and label it in the text file.

All dusts, ingots, blocks, and ores of the same kind from different mods should be the same texture.
(there may be exceptions to this)

I recommend this site for a list of mods.
